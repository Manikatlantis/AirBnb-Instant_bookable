# AirBnb-Instant_bookable

This ML problem focuses on figuring out whether a particular AirBnb is instantly bookable or not based on the airbnb_listings data.

The data-preprocessing steps and modeling along with testing steps are discussed in detail in the DefineAndSolveMLProblem Ultimate Final.ipynb file

I will utilize the airbnbLisitngsData.csv file that is available in this repository.
